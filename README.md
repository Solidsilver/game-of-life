# game-of-life
A recreation of Conway's Game of Life

This contains two versions: A command line version, and a GUI version.
The cmdline only works properly on unix systems (as it makes use of the newline character sequence) and is fairly laggy on grid sizes over 100^2
Run the cmdline version by compiling and running the GameOfLife.java file.
The GUI version is much faster and can handle larger grids, and supports scrolling. However, the scrolling is a bit odd at the moment.
Run the GUI version by compiling all files, then running GOLUI.java
